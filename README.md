# Snake-Game-using-cpp
Developed snake game using C++ and some graphics functions.

This snake game is a simple game wherein there is a snake and the food that the snake wants to eat.
Everytime the snake swallows a grain of food, it grows a little in size.
The more food the player makes the snake eat, the more is the score.

The player has to make the snake go to the food grains using the W (up), S (down), D (left) and A (right) keys.
The food grains appear at random positions everytime.

The only constraint is: if the snake goes out of the borders present on the left and the right side on the output screen, the snake dies and the player loses.

Softwares Used: DOSBOX, TURBOC++
